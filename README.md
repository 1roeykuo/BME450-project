#Project Description
  We plan on using pytorch and AI to diagnos whether an ultrasound breast cancer image is either benign, malignant, or normal. Since 1999, we have seen an increase in around 70,000 new breast cancer cases each year. The last recording in 2019, by the CDC, found a little over 260,000 new breast cancer cases in the United States alone[1]. These statistics make breast cancer the most common form of cancer found within females. Because of how common this cancer is, it is important for women to constantly check for tumors or masses in order to stay healthy. Current methods of testing require an ultrasound, mammogram, MRI and biopsy[2]. The present processes need extensive resources such as time and money, which may lead to fewer women getting tested. By created an AI system, we are able to take the initial ultrasound and provide a prelimilary diagnosis. If negative, this will prevent any extra resources wasted as the testing process may be concluded. This AI will be trained using a series of images provided by kaggle[3]. There will be 3 provided datasets; malignant, benign, and normal. Each set will be labeled to the AI beforehand. The AI system will then take the ultrasound scan of interest and compare it to each of the three datasets. Finally, the AI will provide a prelimilary diagnosis. This can be reviewed by a physician depending on the patient's decision.
